Why would *anyone* want to become proficient with `*nix`? Surely it is software from the time of Watergate and the "Winter of Discontent", forgotten on ancient floppy disks in now decommissioned nuclear missile silos?

While it is indeed true that `*nix` was born at the height of the Cold War, it is *also* true that it is running your smartphone, tablet, television, Wi-Fi router and most of the massive tech giants' infrastructure.

You *could* argue that like the internal combustion engine, `*nix` has been iteratively perfected over a very long time.

However these tutorials are aimed at people who need to:

1. *Manipulate **large** amounts of data* (Gigabytes or more, or stated differently, millions of records/fields or more)

2. *Flexibly* (Plain text, character delimited values, markup like HTML or XML etc, in ways that are impractical or impossible in spreadsheets)

3. *Quickly* (Meaning the *execution time* of the solution. Performance is certainly important if you're doing Big Data)

4. *Consistently* (Repeating arbitrary permutations of ad-hoc data transformations is error prone in spreadsheet land)

5. *Easily\** (Meaning the time/effort/knowledge it takes to cobble together the "mad scientist" plumbing).

<small>\* Obviously, the learning curve is steep enough to have kept you out of the magician's club until now. But once you're in, things happen rather chop-chop.</small>
