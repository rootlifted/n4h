Why would anyone want to become proficient with `*nix`? Surely it is software from the time of Watergate and the "Winter of Discontent", forgotten on ancient floppy disks in nuclear missile silos?

While it is indeed true that `*nix` was born in the height of the Cold War, it is *also* true that it is running your smartphone, tablet, television, wifi router and most of the massive tech giants' infrastructure.

You *could* argue that like the internal combustion engine, `*nix` has been iteratively perfected over a very long time.

However these tutorials are aimed at people who need to:

1. *Manipulate **large** amounts of data* (Gigabytes or more, or stated differently, millions of records/fields or more)

2. *Flexibly* (Plain text, character delimited values, markup like HTML or XML etc, in ways that are impractical or impossible in spreadsheets)

3. *Quickly* (Meaning the *execution time* of the solution. Performance is certainly important if you're doing Big Data)

4. *Consistently* (Repeating arbitrary permutations of ad-hoc data transformations is error prone in spreadsheet land)

5. *Easily\** (Meaning the time/effort/knowledge it takes to cobble together the "mad scientist" plumbing).

<small>\* Obviously, the learning curve is steep enough to have kept you out of the magician's club until now. But once you're in, things happen rather chop-chop.</small>
